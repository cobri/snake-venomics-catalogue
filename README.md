# Snake venomics catalogue

* A web app to display snake venom proteomics data.
* This project is part of the 7th cohort of the [Open Life Science Program.](https://openlifesci.org/ols-7)

## Project description

Snake venoms are incredibly complex mixtures of many different proteins called toxins. Understanding which particular toxins are in the venoms of each snake is important information for researchers working with snakes, particularly for those involved in the development of anti-venoms.

There have been many previous studies which have identified which toxins are in the venom of each snake. This is incredibly valuable information, but the data is trapped in tables, and scattered across many different scientific papers. 

Therefore, the aim of this project is to create a tool that combines data from the different studies of snake venoms, and visualises the data in an easy-to-use online app. I hope it will be of use to researchers working with snake venoms and anti-venoms, and herpetologists.

## Vision statement

>I am creating a web app to display snake venom proteomics data from different studies, so that biologists and researchers can access and visualise this data in an easy-to-use online tool, thus accelerating their research.
